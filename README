pngscale is a specialized tool for scaling down of PNG files to create
thumbnails. It works scanline by scanline, so it's memory-efficient
even on extremely large PNG images, taking only about 11 MB of RAM in
experiments. It is also faster than ImageMagick convert, particularly
on large images, running about twice as fast on a 50 megapixel file.

It produces 24-bpp RGB thumbnails of palettized and 16-bit images and
8-bpp grayscale thumbnails of grayscale images. It has not been tested
with progressive or interlaced images, and cannot upscale images.
Error messages are currently English-only.

pngscale is produced by Derrick Coetzee and released under the MIT/X11
license, which permits any use commercial or noncommercial as long as
the license statement is retained. It is based on a sample by
Guillaume Cottenceau and contributors released under the MIT/X11
